# learnopengl-cpp-sfml
This repo is to keep track of my progress at [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/Introduction).

I'm using C++, SFML and GLAD.
OpenGL version is 4.6.

Since this repo is intented as a personal record of my progress, and not a real project, expect it to be cumbersome sometimes.
I would gladly listen to tips about good practises or whatever thing that could be improved though :)

Keep yourself curious.
